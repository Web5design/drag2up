Now, I know what you're asking. Why does drag2up have a server component?

It's actually pretty simple really, this is a glorified URL shortener that
doesnt really make things that short. But it has the nice property of being
able to get reset based on a certain magic token, and has customized messages
for when things are still being uploaded.
